### 1.游戏介绍 Game Introduction

游戏的背景是在不久的将来，人类过度开荒，地球贤源不断枯竭。有一天，五大洲上出现了五个巨大的黑洞正在吞噬地球，地球危在旦夕。传闻只要集齐游荡于世界各地的金、木、水、火、土五个“神球”，并分别将其置入黑洞中，就可以拯救地球。但由于环境污染严重，五个“神球”已经黯然无光。所以，我们需要做的就是先“摩擦摩擦”。

The background of this game is set in the near future, when the earth's resources are exhausted due to excessive exploitation. One day, five giant black holes appears on five continents and are eating the Earth, putting the earth in danger. Rumor has it that the earth can be saved by collecting the five "god spheres" of metal, wood, water, fire and earth that wander around the world and placing them into a black hole. However, due to serious environmental pollution, the five  "god spheres" have lost their luster. So, all we need to do is control those balls.

- 游戏伴随着音乐进行，界面上出现五个速度随机的灰色小球，它们会在相互碰撞后改变原来的速度。

- 如果小球从页面的上方穿过，则会从下方出现；同样，如果小球从左边进入，则会从右边出来。

- 鼠标的活动范围被限定在下方的玻璃面板上，通过一定的频率不断地移动鼠标，会使得相应的小球从灰色变成绿色并停止移动，此时可以使用w、s、a、d按键分别上、下、左、右移动小球。

- 当玩家将绿色的小球移动到背景中黑洞的上方，按下空格键会检查该小球的位置是否完全覆盖黑洞，如果是的话，小球将被固定在黑洞中，此后其他球将忽略它，直接从它上方飘过。

- 需要注意的是，如果玩家的小球变绿色了，在放入黑洞前要时刻提防着其他球的碰撞，因为一旦发生碰撞，绿色的小球就会马上脱离控制（变成灰色），并重新获得随机的速度。

- 在歌曲播完之前，如果玩家能把所有的小球都成功地固定在每个黑洞中，游戏胜利。

- The game is accompanied by background music. Five gray balls with random speed appears in the interface. They will change their original speed after colliling with each other. 

- If the ball passes through the top of the page, it will appear from the bottom. Similarly, if the ball comes in from the left, it comes out on the right.

- The movement range of the MOUSE is limited within the glass panel below. By constantly moving the mouse at a certain frequency, the corresponding ball will change from gray to green and stop moving. At this time, the W, S, A and D key-buttons can be used to move the ball up, down, left and right respectively.

- When the player moves the green ball over the black hole in the background, pressing the SPACE bar,and the game will check whether the ball's position completely covers the black hole or not. If so, the ball will be fixed in the black hole, after which other balls will ignore it and float directly over it.

- It is important to note that if the ball turns green, watch out for collisions with other balls before placing it in the black hole, as the green ball willl immediately go out of control (turn gray) and regain a random speed. 

- Before the song ends, if the player successfully pins all the balls into each black hole, he or she wins this game.
